    <h1>hi, im Lulu <span class="accent">(Cat)</span></h1>
    <p class="note">theme is basically black and pink. everything else is fur and chaos.</p>
    <p>she is a little cow-pattern cat, white and black spots everywhere. born in march 2025, in the rain, in Beijing. her mom walked away, and i couldn't. so she came home with me, wrapped in a tiny towel, shaking but already bossy.</p>

    <p>lulu is female, mischievous but smart. Her english is still in progress (she only knows the word <em>kitten</em> so far), but she's confident she'll be fluent soon.</p>

    <p>In august 2025, I took her to New York City. we had a stop in Istanbul, twelve hours of airports, tuna snacks, and attitude. she didn't meow once, but she stared at everyone like they owed her an explanation.</p>

    <p>favorite food? salmon and beef, though she mostly eats dry cat food because i have a schedule and she doesn't. she forgives me when i bring toys.</p>

    <p>you can read more <a href="about.html">about her here</a> or check out her <a href="gallery.html">photos</a>. one day she'll probably write her own blog. until then, i'm her secretary.</p>
